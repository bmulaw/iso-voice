# iso-voice

## Small app to play music where song vocals are isolated. Will try two different strategies:

### 1) Use Web Audio API to manipulate audio quality before selected song plays.
### 2) Build a bot that takes any given song file and automatically transform the audio via Audacity software (unfortunately, there are no public API)
